ManagerAudio
	I guess there's two solutions:
	1) Having a limited number of AudioSources and juggle between them.
	2) Just creating as many AudioSources whenever.

	And two approaches to its distribution:
	1) Everything encapsulated in the ManagerAudio containing Object
	2) Every AudioSource just spread wherever.
